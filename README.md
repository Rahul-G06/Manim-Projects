Manim is an engine for precise programmatic animations, designed for creating explanatory math videos.

Note, there are two versions of manim. This repository began as a personal project by the author of 3Blue1Brown for the purpose of animating those videos.

This code is specifically for Manim Community v0.18.1

This repository contains code that I have written in the process of learning Manim and creating animations for my college.
